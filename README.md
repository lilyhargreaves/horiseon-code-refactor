# Module 1 Challenge: Horiseon Code Refractor

## Description

This project was executed to improve the overall accessibility of SEO & Digital Marketing Agency Horiseon's website. Previously, the website's code only used non-semantic HTML elements, however this project has updated the code to ensure that semantic elements are used throughout. Using semantic elements ensures that people with disabilities can access Horiseon's website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. The added layer of accessibility will also ensure the site is better positioned in search engines like Google.
